I use DLB as the data structure of storing the history. 

Each node is given with an additional attribution, int, to state the frequncy. 

The int attribution of nodes whose value is '^', is the freq of the word. 

When fetching the suggestions, I use treeMap to fetch corresponding words and freq. The key is the word, and the value is the freq. 

I used this method because the history data will not be as long as an dictionary, this method will not be significantly slow with small
data.
