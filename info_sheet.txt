Additional comments to the grader:
Every time I execute the first searching in a run, the runtime of the searching takes a much longer time than any other searchings afterwards. 
I can't find the problem that causes this problem, because when I executed the same searching afterwards, 
the runtime of the searching is significantly smaller than the runtime of the first time. 
I find that the runtime difference is in the DLB.searchingSuggestions(). 
I commented the section that I tested that causes significance runtime difference.
